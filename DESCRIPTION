Description: This package performs phylogenetic comparative model (PCM) selection on 
    a phylogenetic tree with phenotypic data at its tips. The phylogenetic comparative
    model is selected from a set of mixed Gaussian phylogenetic models (MGPMs), 
    such as combinations of Brownian motion (BM) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) 
    processes running on different lineages of the tree.
