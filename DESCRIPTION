Description: Fast maximum likelihood fit and model selection of phylogenetic 
    comparative models (PCMs) to a phylogenetic tree and multivariate trait
    data at its tips. Supports Gaussian and mixed Gaussian phylogenetic models 
    (MGPM) over all types of trees (including non-ultrametric trees and 
    polytomies). Supports non-existing traits or missing measurements for some 
    of the traits on some of the species. Supports specifying or inferring 
    measurement error for the trait values associated with each tip of the tree. 
    The Gaussian phylogenetic models include various parametrizations of 
    Brownian motion (BM) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) multivariate branching 
    processes. The mixed Gaussian models represent models with shifts in the 
    model parameters as well as the type of model at points of the tree. Each 
    shift-point is described as a couple of shift-nodes and associated type of
    model (e.g. OU or BM) driving the trait evolution from the beginning of the 
    branch leading to the shift-node toward the shift-node and its descendants 
    until reaching a tip or another shift-point. The function PCMFit is used to 
    fit a given PCM or a MGPM for a given tree with specified shift-points. The
    function PCMFitMixed is used to fit an ensemble of possible MGPMs over a 
    tree for which the shift-points are unknown. This function can perform model
    selection of the best MGPM for a given tree and data according to an 
    information loss criterios such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC).
