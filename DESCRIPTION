Description: This package performs phylogenetic comparative model (PCM) selection on 
    a phylogenetic tree with phenotypic data at its tips. The phylogenetic comparative
    model is selected from a set of multi-regime mixed Gaussian models (MRGs), 
    such as combinations of Brownian motion (BM) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) 
    processes running on different lineages of the tree. The function SearchForwardBackward
    performs a greedy search of the best assignment of "break-nodes" on the tree 
    up to a given number of nodes. Each "break-node" assignment defines a "coloring"
    of the branches in the tree, such that each color (or regime)
    is mapped to an instance of a specific PCM, such as BM
    or OU. For each "break-node" assignment, the best regime mapping is found using
    an optimal information score like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
