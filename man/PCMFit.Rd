\title{Fitting a PCM model to a given tree and data}
\usage{
PCMFit(X, tree, model, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a \code{k x N} numerical matrix with possible \code{NA} entries. Each
column of X contains the measured trait values for one species (tip in tree).
Depending on the value of the global option "PCMBase.Internal.PC.Full" \code{NA}
entries are interpreted either as missing measurements or non-existing traits
(see \code{\link{PCMPresentCoordinates}}).}

\item{tree}{a phylo object with N tips.}

\item{model}{an S3 object specifying both, the model type (class, e.g. "OU") as
well as the concrete model parameter values at which the likelihood is to be
calculated (see also Details).}
}
\value{
an object of class PCMFit
}
